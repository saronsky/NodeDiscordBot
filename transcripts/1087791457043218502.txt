What will Trump's arrest actually look like? Former President Donald Trump may be just hours away from becoming the first ex-US president to be charged with a crime. So what happens now? The grand jury has been hearing evidence for weeks about a $130,000 hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. The money was to keep quiet about their alleged affair. The next step would be for the grand jury to vote on the charges, which could happen this week. Then the grand jury foreperson has to sign the indictment. Then it's official. Normally in a high profile white collar case like this, the prosecutors would then negotiate a surrender date in Manhattan with the defendant's lawyers. The defendant shows up, gets booked with the fingerprints and the mugshot, and then they walk over to the courtroom and enter a plea. Guilty or not guilty. Trump, however, is protected by the Secret Service and they're not likely to let him get that close to reporters or random people in the courthouse. Trump has called on his supporters to protest and is reportedly thinking that he could benefit by showing up to be arrested in person. He could make a spectacle of the proceedings and reinforce his whole message that this is all a big witch hunt. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has decisions to make too. He might feel like he needs to show that Trump is not above the law and is being treated like anybody else charged with a crime. But the reality is that a former president isn't like everyone else. And after what happened at the US Capitol on January 6th, security at the courthouse is a big concern. So Bragg might decide to do as much as possible to de-escalate the situation. Which could mean avoiding any scenes that would enrage Trump supporters.
