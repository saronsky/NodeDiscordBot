Credit Suisse sent all their private banking customers an offer, they are now offering 6.5% for a three month T-bill. If you go back to when the risk-free rate is somewhere north of five or five and a half percent and banks are willing to give you six and a half percent in the short term, you have to generate more than three times that to make an investment make sense when you're investing in the long term. So if three month money is gonna pay you six and a half or seven, if you're gonna invest for 10, 15 years, which is what you need to do typically for a startup, you need to get 20 to 25%. So there's gonna be a lot of pressure for venture investors to put the money to work.
