I don't get why he's buying treasuries. Wait. Explain. I can't explain. Okay. Yes. Okay, we'll bring back to what you said. Okay. They raised the rates yesterday. But the fact that he raised the rates doesn't necessarily mean all the rates are going to continue to go up. Uh-huh. Okay? Now remember, your treasury rates go opposite with the prices. Bond prices are inversely related to the rate, vice versa, or whatever. So when Powell raises the rates, when the Fed raises the rates, they're raising the discount rate. They're raising the rates between banks. Banks have to borrow from banks on a daily basis. Got it. Because sometimes they run out of liquidity, or they put too many loans out, and tomorrow morning they need to fund things, and they don't have enough demand deposits, core deposits. So what they do is they borrow. From each other. From each other. So that's what the Fed fund rates technically sets. That's why you say, you hear him say, we expect the Fed funds rate to be in the fives. That's how much it costs for banks to keep their liquidity, technically. That's how they control the money supply, which controls inflation. So if they raise the rates really high, right, if Powell does what he's done, it makes it expensive for banks to borrow from each other in the banking system. And when it makes it expensive for them to borrow, what do they do? They raise the prices, the interest rates on loans they put out. Because it costs them so much, you know, to fund their loans, to operate for liquidity, right? So what happens when they raise rates on loans? Look at the mortgage, 30-year mortgage. It's 6-plus percent. It definitely slows people from buying houses. So that makes Treasuries drop. It makes everything more expensive. Your credit cards are more expensive. Now your auto loans are more expensive. What's the effect of that? You want to borrow less. If you want to borrow less, what's the effect of that? You slow the economy down, right? That's how they try to control inflation. They're putting the rates really high, the Fed funds rate really high, so it costs banks more, it makes it more expensive for banks. And banks are the ones that distribute the money into the economy. I mean, it's a lot more complicated than that, but to simplify it. So just because he raised the rates yesterday, it's making it more expensive, right? So what happens when, okay, my hypothesis, okay, is pretty simple. Raising rates slows down the economy. When you slow down the economy, what's the talk about? Soft landing, recession, hard landing. Things are going to slow down. What happens when that happens, right? There's a flight to safety. Flight to safety means people rotate other equities and risk assets into risk-off assets. A risk-off asset is a treasury bill. So what happens when all the money floods into something? Supply and demand. What happens to the price? The price goes down. No. When everyone buys it, oh, oh, yes. When your demand goes up, your price goes up. So I just bought treasuries now because I'm expecting a slowdown, a flight to safety, and treasury prices. But I also, you have to understand duration. I laddered it on the duration that I purchased. I laddered it. I see. Because there's lower yield here on the further out ones because the yield curve is inverted. I don't want to get into that. That's too complicated. Okay, okay, okay. We'll talk about that. Whenever. I'll tell you why. So why did I buy the treasuries? The real reason is not like a big freaking epiphany or anything. I bought it because I've been sitting in cash for a while. Yeah. And it's been in and out of cash for a couple months now. So I just decided, you know what? I might as well just put, you know, when it goes into cash, I earn nothing. My accounts get swept at like 10 basis points. That's stupid. So finally I just realized, screw it. I'm just going to load up on the treasuries, ladder, whatever. I might make money on that, but worst case scenario, I hold them to maturity. I'm buying all short-term stuff within a year. I'll get my returns back. They're paying anywhere between the mid-fours to the high-threes is my ladders. So that I make some yield on the money. And if I want to trade something now, you know, and I need to open a big position, whatever, I leverage it. I can get up to 80%, 85% leverage on my treasuries. So I keep my capital earning while I think about what to do in this volatile market. That's why. Got it.
