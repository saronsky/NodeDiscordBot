Hundreds of thousands joined a rally in Mexico City with President LÃ³pez Obrador to mark 85 years since the expropriation of Mexico's oil resources from foreign corporations. But we will never, ever allow them to violate our sovereignty and trample the dignity of our homeland. Cooperation? Yes. Submission? No. Interventionism? No. Long live oil expropriation! Long live the workers and technicians of the former and now of the national oil industry! Long live Mexico!
